A (Possibly New?) Approach to Dynamic Dispatch via Traits

In my language, I want to support dynamic dispatch through traits
(think: interfaces in Java, protocols in Swift, prototypes in JS).
I’ll call them "traits" here.

From real-world code I care about, I’ve observed:

* Most traits are small — very few have > 32 methods,
  though some rare ones have up to 200.
  We can ignore "marker traits".

* Most types implement few traits — often none; the distribution is Zipf-like.
  In one large project (Apache Jackrabbit Oak), the max is 7 traits per type.

* I want fast instanceof checks for both traits and concrete types.

* Traits can require/extend other traits
  (e.g., ReaderWriter requires Reader).

== My Dispatch Plan

I’d like feedback on this idea — does anyone see pitfalls?

1. Compile-time slot assignment

   * Each trait gets a unique ID and a slot number.
   * Two traits can share the same slot unless they appear together on a type.
   * Most traits end up in slot 0 (in Java’s JDK: ~78% in slot 0, 13% in slot 1, max slot = 17).
   * Downside: all types/traits must be known at compile-time — acceptable for my use case.

2. Object layout

   * Every object has a pointer to type metadata
     as the first field
     (no fat pointers to avoids concurrency issues).

3. Type metadata layout

    Contains:
    * One vtable with all trait functions, grouped / ordered by trait slot.
    * An “offset” array to locate the first function for a trait slot.
      Simulations show ~66% fill rate for the offset array.

== How Calls Work

At compile time, both the slot and traitFunctionId are known.

  * Trait slot 0 (~78%): vtable[traitFunctionId]
  * Trait slot >0: vtable[offset[slot] + traitFunctionId]

Most calls hit slot 0, so dispatch is very simple —
potentially competitive with Java/C++.

This is similar to Argentum’s approach but a bit simpler (no perfect hash tables).

instanceof / Trait Casting

A secondary structure holds an array of trait ID for each slot.
Check: slot < traitIdArray.length && traitIdArray[slot] == traitId.


Question: Am I overlooking obvious issues here —
either in performance characteristics or in edge cases with trait inheritance?
Are there other languages you know that use this or a similar approach?

Total classes analyzed: 5,855
Classes implementing no interface methods: 4,882 (83.4%)
Classes implementing at least one interface method: 973 (16.6%)

* Most interfaces have few methods:

Based on the analysis of 973 classes that implement interfaces (this is our 100% baseline),
here are the percentages for each threshold:
Distribution by Method Count Thresholds:
≤ 2 interface methods: 39.7% (386 classes)
≤ 4 interface methods: 56.4% (549 classes)
≤ 8 interface methods: 81.9% (797 classes)
≤ 16 interface methods: 91.8% (893 classes)
≤ 32 interface methods: 98.5% (958 classes)


interfaces (trait), like in Rust
for interfaces, support instanceof and cast
