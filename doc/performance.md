# Performance and Efficiency

Performance and efficiency have multiple aspects: ease of learning and usage
(developer productivity), compilation speed, startup time, runtime performance, and memory usage.

This language transpiles to C, which has a highly optimized toolchain, and is available
for embedded systems, desktops, and servers.
Startup time is significantly faster than that of virtual machine-based languages like Java or C#, 
as there is no VM or runtime to initialize.
Runtime performance: this language aims to be in the same category as high-performance languages
such as C, Rust, Go, Java, and Swift.
To ensure low memory usage and to avoid GC pauses, it does not use tracing garbage collection.

Memory safety results in runtime overhead from reference counting and array bounds checking.
However, for performance-critical sections, this overhead can be mitigated:
The language supports ownership semantics for references, and range-restricted index variables,
so that the compiler can eliminate these checks where applicable.
The complexity of these features is however not needed in the majority of the cases,
which results in simple code and high productivity.

## Benchmarks

| Benchmark              |  Bau |   C  |  Go  | Java |Python| Rust |
|------------------------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| Binary Trees           |  5.1 |  5.0 |  5.6 |  3.7 | 10.5 |  5.8 |
| Fannkuch Redux         |  1.9 |  1.9 |  2.2 |  2.0 |  9.7 |  1.9 |
| SpeedTest              |  1.8 |  1.8 |  3.2 |  4.5 |270.0 |  1.7 |
| Pi Digits              |  2.9 |  0.3 |  1.0 |  3.5 |  5.1 |  1.4 |
| Mandelbrot             |  3.5 |  3.5 |  3.5 |  3.6 |108.0 |  3.8 |

Only a small number of benchmarks are implemented so far, most of them are based on
the microbenchmarks from <a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>.

For all languages, a very simple single-threaded implementation is used 
(without inline assembly etc.).
Memory usage  is not currently measured.
The tests are run 3 times, and the best time is used.
Benchmark results in seconds (lower is better).
For Java, memory is limited to 100 MB by using `-mx100m`, 
and the just-in-time compiler is pre-warmed
by running the same test 3 times inside the same JVM 
(which is arguably not quite fair).

So in summary, for these benchmarks, Bau has a similar performance
then other popular programming languages, specially C.
Which makes sense, because it is transpiled to C.
It is sometimes slower, and sometimes faster, than Java, Go, and Rust.

#### Binary Trees

This test 
<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/binarytrees.html#binarytrees">generates binary trees and counts the nodes</a>.
The Java version is very fast if given enough memory, because it doesn't collect garbage;
when limiting memory to 100 MB, it does collect garbage, but in a different thread.
For Bau, the ownership variant is used; the reference counted variant is a bit slower.
Bau includes a faster malloc implementation, which would brings performance close to Java.

#### Fannkuch Redux

This test simulates
<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/fannkuchredux.html#fannkuchredux">flipping pancakes</a>.
This test uses many array accesses. For Bau, no attempt was made to eliminate bound checks.

#### SpeedTest

This test is about the <a href="https://github.com/jabbalaci/SpeedTests">MÃ¼nchausen numbers problem</a>.
This is a very fast loop with a lot of array access. 
(Standard) Python is particularly slow here because it is interpreted and doesn't use a JIT compiler.

#### Pi Digits

This uses a big integer library that computes
<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/pidigits.html#pidigits">10'000 digits of Pi</a>.
Performance depends mostly on the big integer library.
The big integer library of Go, for example, is highly optimized, and using platform-specific assembly.
The Rust library is highly optimized as well, but the C "gmp" library is the fastest.
The Bau bigint library is around 400 lines of code, modelled after the Java library,
without platform-specific code.
Bau could easily use the "gmp" library as well.

#### Mandelbrot

This test computes the
<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/description/mandelbrot.html#mandelbrot">Mandelbrot set</a>.
It is mostly testing floating point performance.
