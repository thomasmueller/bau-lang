# Performance and Efficiency

Performance and efficiency have multiple aspects: ease of learning and usage
(developer productivity), compilation speed, startup time, runtime performance, and memory usage.

This language transpiles to C, which has a highly optimized toolchain, and is available
for embedded systems and server usage. This added step does slow down compilation a bit,
compared to pure C.

Startup time is significantly faster than that of virtual machine-based languages like Java or C#, 
as there is no VM or runtime to initialize.

Runtime performance: this language aims to compete with high-performance languages
such as C, Rust, Go, Java, and Swift.
It avoids a tracing garbage collector, which results in low memory usage and eliminates GC pauses.

Memory safety results in runtime overhead from reference counting and array bounds checking.
However, for performance-critical sections, this overhead can be mitigated:
The language supports ownership semantics for references, and range-restricted index variables,
so that the compiler can eliminate these checks where applicable.
The complexity of these features is however not needed in the majority of the cases,
which results in simple code and high productivity.

## Benchmarks

Only a small number of benchmarks are implemented so far, most of them are from
<a href="https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/index.html">The Computer Language Benchmarks Game</a>
The implementations are simple conversions of the original Java code.
For all languages, a very simple single-threaded implementation is used (without inline assembly etc.).

Benchmark results in seconds (lower is better; best of 3 runs):

|Benchmark               |  C |Java| Bau|
|------------------------|----|----|----|
|Binary Trees            | 5.0| 3.4| 3.4|
|Fannkuch Redux          | 2.2| 2.4| 2.2|
|SpeedTest               | 1.8| 4.4| 1.8|


### Binary Trees

This test generates a number of binary trees and counts the nodes.
The Java version is very fast if given enough memory, because it doesn't collect garbage;
when limiting memory to 128 MB, it i similar in speed than C.
In Bau, a faster malloc implementation is used, which is faster than the default one.
If C uses the same malloc implementation, it is as fast as Bau.
For Bau, the ownership variant is used; the reference counted variant is 3.7 seconds.

### Fannkuch Redux

This test uses many array accesses. For Bau, no attempt was made to eliminate them.
